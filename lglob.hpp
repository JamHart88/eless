/*
 * Macros to define the method of doing filename "globbing".
 * There are three possible mechanisms:
 *   1.    GLOB_LIST
 *    This defines a function that returns a list of matching filenames.
 *   2. GLOB_NAME
 *    This defines a function that steps thru the list of matching
 *    filenames, returning one name each time it is called.
 *   3. GLOB_STRING
 *    This defines a function that returns the complete list of
 *    matching filenames as a single space-separated string.
