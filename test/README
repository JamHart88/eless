Testing is using google test
https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googletest
Assumes this is installed on your system

Also need to install "lcov" (sudo apt install lcov) and 
helpful to run with valgrind (sudo apt install valgrind).
 

Run make to compile mocks.cpp in the main test folder.

To compile and run, go to the unit test folder, e.g. ifile_test
and type the following:
	./setup.sh
	make run

"make run" will compile and run the test with coverage.

To run the test and check for memory leaks, run it separately
with
	valgrind --leak-check=full test_ifile
