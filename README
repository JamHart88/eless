=========================================================================

This is the distribution of "less", a paginator similar to "more" or "pg".

The formatted manual page is in less.man.
The manual page nroff source is in less.nro.
Major changes made since the last posted version are in NEWS.

=======================================================================
To build:

jhar TODO: These may need to be updated:

1. It is a good idea to look over the generated Makefile and defines.h
   and make sure they look ok.  If you know of any peculiarities of
   your system that configure might not have detected, you may fix the
   Makefile now.  Take particular notice of the list of "terminal" 
   libraries in the LIBS definition in the Makefile; these may need 
   to be edited.  The terminal libraries will be some subset of
       -lncurses  -lcurses  -ltermcap  -ltermlib

   If you wish, you may edit defines.h to remove some optional features.
   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may
   wish to edit the manual page "less.nro" and the help page "less.hlp" 
   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.
   If you edit less.hlp, you should run "make -f Makefile.aut help.c".

4. Type "make" and watch the fun.

5. If the make succeeds, it will generate the programs "eless" in the
   current directoy

6. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it
   in a public place, type "make install".

   The default install destinations are:
        Executables (less) in /usr/local/bin
        Documentation (less.nro, lesskey.nro) in /usr/local/man/man1
   If you want to install any of these files elsewhere, define
   bindir and/or mandir to the appropriate directories.

If you have any problems building or running "less", suggestions, 
complaints, etc., you may mail to bug-less@gnu.org.

Note to hackers: comments noting possible improvements are enclosed
in double curly brackets {{ like this }}.

(Note that the above note was originally written at a time when 
"hackers" most commonly meant "enthusiastic and dedicated computer 
programmers", not "persons who attempt to circumvent computer security".)
